# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built using React Native. It fetches data from the OpenWeather API (free version) and displays it to the user.

## Installation

1. Obtain an API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Create a file `keys.js` in the root folder.
3. Enter 1 line into keys.js: `export const API_KEY = '[YOUR API KEY]'`
4. Run with [Expo](https://expo.dev/): `npm start`
